# Angular Starter Project with Modules and separate HTML, CSS and TS files for use on StackBlitz (Angular 16)

The default StackBlitz Angular starter project uses standalone components with inline templates(there is no separate HTML and CSS files for each component). This can be annoying to use for people who have not switched over to standalone components yet or just prefer to use separate HTML/CSS/TS files.

This project was made with Angular CLI 16.0.3 and is the result of creating a new Angular project using the following command:

```
ng new <project-name> --routing --strict
```
